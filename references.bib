	abstract = {The general stress response (GSR) is a widely conserved response that allows bacteria to cope with a multitude of stressful conditions. In the past years the PhyR-NepR-σ(EcfG) cascade was identified as the core pathway regulating the GSR in Alphaproteobacteria, in which it also plays an important role in bacteria-host interactions. The regulatory system is composed of the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor σ(EcfG), its anti-sigma factor NepR (for negative regulator of the PhyR response), and the anti-sigma factor antagonist PhyR (phyllosphere regulator). The three proteins function via a partner-switching mechanism that is triggered by PhyR phosphorylation, termed 'sigma factor mimicry'. This review will cover core features of the pathway, its physiological role, and summarize recent advances towards understanding of the partner-switching mechanism and of the two-component signaling pathways controlling the GSR.},

	abstract = {Alphaproteobacteria include many medically and environmentally important organisms. Despite the diversity of their niches and lifestyles, from free-living to host-associated, they usually rely on very similar mechanisms to control their cell cycles. Studies on Caulobacter crescentus still lay the foundation for understanding the molecular details of pathways regulating DNA replication and cell division and coordinating these two processes with other events of the cell cycle. This review highlights recent discoveries on the regulation and the mode of action of conserved global regulators and small molecules like c-di-GMP and (p)ppGpp, which play key roles in cell cycle control. It also describes several newly identified mechanisms that modulate cell cycle progression in response to stresses or environmental conditions.},

	volume = {70},
	issn = {1468-3288},
	doi = {10.1136/gutjnl-2019-320135},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play essential roles in maintaining gut health and are associated with IBD. This study is to elucidate the effect of angiogenin (ANG), an intestine-secreted AMP, on gut microbiota and its relevance with IBD.
DESIGN: The effect of ANG on microbiota and its contribution to colitis were evaluated in different colitis models with co-housing and faecal microbiota transplantation. ANG-regulated bacteria were determined by 16S rDNA sequencing and their functions in colitis were analysed by bacterial colonisation. The species-specific antimicrobial activity of ANG and its underlying mechanism were further investigated with microbiological and biochemical methods. ANG level and the key bacteria were characterised in IBD faecal samples.
RESULTS: ANG regulated microbiota composition and inhibited intestinal inflammation. Specifically, Ang1 deficiency in mice led to a decrease in the protective gut commensal strains of Lachnospiraceae but an increase in the colitogenic strains of α-Proteobacteria. Direct binding of ANG to α-Proteobacteria resulted in lethal disruption of bacterial membrane integrity, and consequently promoted the growth of Lachnospiraceae, which otherwise was antagonised by α-Proteobacteria. Oral administration of ANG1 reversed the dysbiosis and attenuated the severity of colitis in Ang1-deficient mice. The correlation among ANG, the identified bacteria and IBD status was established in patients.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate a novel role of ANG in shaping gut microbe composition and thus maintaining gut health, suggesting that the ANG-microbiota axis could be developed as a potential preventive and/or therapeutic approach for dysbiosis-related gut diseases.},
