title: "Motivating Reasons"
---

1.  One of the motivations for this research stems from an increasing scientific interest in understanding how microbial communities influence and are influenced by wetland ecosystems. Wetlands serve crucial ecological functions, including water filtration and carbon storage, and microbes are at the heart of these processes.
2.  Studying these microorganisms helps predict the impacts of environmental changes on wetland health and informs conservation strategies. The Chase Lake Wetlands serve as an important case study due to their unique ecological characteristics and the pressures they face from agricultural runoff and climate change.
