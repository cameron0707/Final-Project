Chase Lake Wetlands, also known as Woodworth (WOOD), is a terrestrial NEON field site located near Woodworth, North Dakota, managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Geological
Survey as part of the Chase Lake National Wildlife Refuge (NWR). Covering an 11 km² area, WOOD features a mix of grasslands, agricultural areas, and wetlands within the Missouri Coteau region, known for its
prairie potholes formed by glacial activity. The region has a continental climate with significant temperature variations and moderate annual precipitation (330-508 mm). Winters can drop below -17.8°C, and summers can exceed 32°C. The climate is characterized by strong winds, thunderstorms, and extreme weather events, including hailstorms and tornadoes. The area has a long history of Native American presence and later European settlement. Established in 1908, Chase Lake NWR has been used
for wildlife studies since 1969, focusing on the effects of grazing, burning, and cropping.
